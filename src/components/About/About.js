        <p>
          I've been a fan of anime and video games for as long as I can
          remember. At 9 years old I would race home from school to finish
          homework in time for Dragon Ball Z at 5 pm on Toonami.
        </p>
        <p>
          That nostalgia still hits every time I watch the show and others like
          it. These stories are a great way to escape reality and I want to
          share my thoughts on them with the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that I have accquired the necessary skills to absorb / implement
          new technologies I have built my very own platform utilizing my Front
          End development powers. I'm proud of what I made and I hope you all
          like it as well.
